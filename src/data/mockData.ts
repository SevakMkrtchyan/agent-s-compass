When making an offer on a home, there are several key elements to understand:\n\n**Price**: This is your proposed purchase amount, which may be at, above, or below the listing price depending on market conditions.\n\n**Earnest Money**: A deposit (typically 1-3% of the price) showing you're serious about the purchase.\n\n**Contingencies**: Conditions that must be met for the sale to proceed, such as financing approval, home inspection, or appraisal.\n\n**Closing Timeline**: The proposed date for completing the transaction.\n\nYour agent will help you understand market conditions and craft a competitive offer strategy.

If you back out for reasons not covered by contingencies, the seller may keep it.\n\nYour agent can advise on the appropriate amount for your market and situation.",
